  # With the release of version 2.10, Ansible finally correctly
  # identifies Kali Linux as being the Kali distribution of the Debian
  # OS family.  This simplifies a lot of things for roles that support
  # Kali Linux, so it makes sense to force the installation of Ansible
  # 2.10 or newer.

    # For reasons I haven't been able to discern, the Ubuntu molecule
    # tests work fine locally but fail in GitHub Actions due to being
    # unable to perform some iptables operations.  I would think this
    # was due to some kernel module not being loaded in the underlying
    # host instance, except that the non-Ubuntu platforms pass just
    # fine in GitHub Actions.
    #
    # I've already spent too much time on this, and we don't require
    # the Ubuntu support right now, so I will make the executive
    # decision to remove Ubuntu support for now.  I created this issue
    # to document the error:
