    # For reasons I haven't been able to discern, the Ubuntu molecule
    # tests work fine locally but fail in GitHub Actions due to being
    # unable to perform some iptables operations.  I would think this
    # was due to some kernel module not being loaded in the underlying
    # host instance, except that the non-Ubuntu platforms pass just
    # fine in GitHub Actions.
    #
    # I've already spent too much time on this, and we don't require
    # the Ubuntu support right now, so I will make the executive
    # decision to remove Ubuntu support for now.  I created this issue
    # to document the error:
